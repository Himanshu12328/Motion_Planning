# Motion Planning Projects
This repository contains three projects demonstrating proficiency in various Motion Planning techniques.

## Projects
### Advanced RRT-Based Motion Planner: 
Created an advanced RRT-based motion planner that revolutionized the removal process of the mainshaft from the transmission case, ensuring precision and accuracy while preventing any damage to the surrounding equipment.

### Comparative Analysis of Planning Methods: 
Conducted a comparative analysis of combinatorial and sampling-based planning methods, and their performance in navigating a firetruck through a complex obstacle field, highlighting my deep understanding of motion planning techniques and the ability to evaluate and optimize their effectiveness.

### Simulated Vehicle Parking: 
Demonstrated my proficiency in motion planning by building a simulated world and parking three vehicles into a compact space.
